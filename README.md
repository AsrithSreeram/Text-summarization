# Text-summarization

This is a Text Summarization website developed using Flask. I used the pre-trained Gensim summarization model to generate summaries given a piece of text.

## User Flow
* Input text in the text areas
* Choose type of summary you want to generate (small, medium, or large)
* Click "Submit"

## How to run locally
* Clone this repository
* Import all dependencies (Flask and Gensim)
* Run _flask.run_ in command line
